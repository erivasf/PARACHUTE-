# PARACHUTE-
Project module 1

This is the final version of my game "PARACHUTE". 

Parachute was a game I was obsessed with when I was growing up. Unfurnately, now it´s outdated.

I made this game for the same reason I became a web developer, to create and update thinks that I like. 

The game has three simple commands:

- Left key to aim left.
- Right key to aim right.
- Spacebar to shoot

The game itself consists in shooting all the soldiers before they hit the ground; if they do, you´ll loose a life per soldier.

Every 10 seconds a jet will fly by and drop you a bomb! You´ll need to shoot it twice to destroy it.

The games difficulty increases every 10 seconds, the soldiers will fall faster, leaving you with less time to shoot them all.

Be prepared and have fun!
